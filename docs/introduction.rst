This plugin contains the documentation and component definitions for the OpenMDAO instructional
class that was given at the  National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) Wind Energy Systems
Engineering workshop. The class was given by Justin Gray and Christopher Heath of the NASA Glenn
Research Center. Justin and Chris are members of the OpenMDAO development team and built the
content of this class to demonstrate the basic usage of OpenMDAO with its GUI on some simple wind
turbine design problems. The class covers:

- Basic usage for creating basic components
- Instantiating those components in the GUI to build simple models
- Building optimizations around models, working with design of experiments
- Recording data from your runs
- Building more complex models

The plugin and this tutorial have been updated for compatibility with OpenMDAO Version 0.9.6.

What is OpenMDAO?
========================

The OpenMDAO Graphical User Interface (GUI) is a browser-based application. This means
that the entire GUI is written with HTML5 and Javascript. We call it a browser-based application
and not a "web app" because unlike a web app, the OpenMDAO GUI does not require an active Internet
connection and does not transmit any information across the network. Regardless, the GUI functions
just like a web app in that you interact with it solely through a browser. Also, like many web apps,
the OpenMDAO GUI automatically saves your model as you build it. You never need to manually save
your work.
